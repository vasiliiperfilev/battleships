## Battleships game

This game was made with the TDD approach in mind.
Features:
- Player vs AI mode (written to be easily expanded to Player vs Player but I want to start React now haha)
- AI places ships randomly
- Player can see a shadow of potential ship position during ships placement phase
- All game logic fully implemented (ships positioning, if hit can attack again, draw is possible)

JS, Webpack and Jest were used in this project
